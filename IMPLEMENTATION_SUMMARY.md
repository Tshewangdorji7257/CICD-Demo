- `SONAR_ORGANIZATION`: Use `tshewangdorji7257`

### 2. SonarCloud Project Setup
1. Go to https://sonarcloud.io
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Import your CICD-Demo repository
4. Follow the "With GitHub Actions" setup

### 3. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive security scanning with Snyk and SonarCloud"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Verify Security Pipeline
After pushing:
1. **GitHub Actions**: Check workflow runs in Actions tab
2. **Security Tab**: Verify scan results appear
3. **SonarCloud**: Check dashboard for analysis results
4. **Snyk**: Verify project monitoring
