# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive security scanning and monitoring setup for the CICD-Demo project using **Snyk** and **SonarCloud**.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive security pipeline following the **SWE302 Practical 4 & 4a** requirements, integrating:
- ‚úÖ **Snyk** for dependency vulnerability scanning and SAST
- ‚úÖ **SonarCloud** for code quality and security analysis  
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD security workflows
- ‚úÖ **JaCoCo** for code coverage reporting

## üîß Setup Requirements

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with repository access
- SonarCloud account (free for public repositories)
- Snyk account (free tier available)
- Java 17+ and Maven 3.6+

### Required GitHub Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository (`Settings` ‚Üí `Secrets and variables` ‚Üí `Actions`):

| Secret Name | Description | How to Get |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `SNYK_TOKEN` | Snyk API authentication token | Snyk Dashboard ‚Üí Account Settings ‚Üí API Token |
| `SONAR_TOKEN` | SonarCloud authentication token | SonarCloud ‚Üí My Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Generate Token |
| `SONAR_ORGANIZATION` | Your SonarCloud organization key | SonarCloud ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Administration ‚Üí Organization Key |

## üìã Security Tools Configuration

### 1. Snyk Configuration

**File**: `.snyk`
- Configures vulnerability scanning rules
- Excludes test dependencies from production scans
- Allows ignoring specific vulnerabilities with justification

**Key Features**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking
- Security hotspot identification
- SARIF report generation for GitHub Security tab

### 2. SonarCloud Configuration

**File**: `sonar-project.properties`
- Defines project structure and analysis rules
- Configures code coverage integration
- Sets exclusion patterns for test files

**Key Features**:
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Code quality metrics and technical debt analysis
- Security vulnerability detection
- Quality gate enforcement

## üöÄ GitHub Actions Workflows

### Main Workflow: `maven.yml`
**Triggers**: Push/PR to `master` or `main` branches

**Jobs**:
1. **Test**: Builds and runs unit tests
2. **Snyk Security**: Dependency and code vulnerability scanning
3. **SonarCloud**: Comprehensive code quality and security analysis

### Enhanced Security: `enhanced-security.yml`
**Triggers**: Push/PR + weekly scheduled scans

**Advanced Features**:
- **Multi-matrix scanning**: Dependencies, code, and container security
- **Conditional execution**: Only runs on relevant file changes
- **SARIF upload**: Results integrated into GitHub Security tab
- **Monitoring**: Production dependency tracking
- **Notifications**: Automated alerts for critical vulnerabilities

### Standalone SonarCloud: `sonarcloud.yml`
**Triggers**: Push/PR with quality gate enforcement

## üìä Security Reporting

### GitHub Security Tab Integration
All security scan results are automatically uploaded to GitHub's Security tab via SARIF format:
- Navigate to `Security` ‚Üí `Code scanning` in your repository
- View detailed vulnerability reports with remediation guidance
- Track security trends over time

### Coverage Reports
- **JaCoCo**: Generates XML and HTML coverage reports
- **Integration**: Coverage data sent to SonarCloud for analysis
- **Location**: `target/site/jacoco/` after running tests

## üîç Quality Gates

### SonarCloud Quality Gate
Enforces security and quality standards:
- **Zero tolerance** for new security vulnerabilities
- **All security hotspots** must be reviewed
- **Minimum coverage** thresholds enforced
- **Code duplications** and maintainability checks

### Build Failure Conditions
The pipeline fails if:
- High/critical severity vulnerabilities found by Snyk
- SonarCloud quality gate fails
- Unit tests fail
- Build compilation errors

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

### Running Security Scans Locally

```bash
# Install Snyk CLI
npm install -g snyk

# Authenticate with Snyk
snyk auth

# Run dependency scan
snyk test --maven

# Run code scan (requires Snyk Code enabled)
snyk code test

# Run SonarCloud analysis (requires SONAR_TOKEN)
mvn clean verify sonar:sonar \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=your-org_cicd-demo \
  -Dsonar.organization=your-org \
  -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io \
  -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_TOKEN
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
mvn clean verify

# Run tests without coverage (faster)
mvn clean test

# Generate coverage report only
mvn jacoco:report
```

## üìà Monitoring and Maintenance

### Scheduled Scans
- **Weekly automated scans** run every Monday at 2 AM UTC
- **Dependency monitoring** tracks new vulnerabilities in production
- **Security advisories** automatically checked

### Vulnerability Management Process
1. **Detection**: Automated scans identify vulnerabilities
2. **Assessment**: Review severity and exploitability
3. **Remediation**: Apply fixes or document acceptance
4. **Verification**: Re-scan to confirm resolution

### Ignoring Vulnerabilities
When a vulnerability is determined to be a false positive or acceptable risk:

1. Add to `.snyk` file:
```yaml
ignore:
  'SNYK-JAVA-GROUPID-VULNID':
    - '*':
        reason: 'Justification for ignoring'
        expires: '2024-12-31T23:59:59.999Z'
```

2. Document the decision in security review

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Snyk Token Authentication Failure**
- Verify `SNYK_TOKEN` secret is correctly set
- Ensure token hasn't expired
- Check token permissions in Snyk dashboard

**SonarCloud Analysis Fails**
- Verify `SONAR_TOKEN` and `SONAR_ORGANIZATION` secrets
- Check project key format: `{organization}_{repository-name}`
- Ensure SonarCloud project exists and is properly configured

**Quality Gate Failures**
- Review SonarCloud dashboard for specific issues
- Check if new vulnerabilities were introduced
- Verify all security hotspots have been reviewed

**Build Failures**
- Check Maven compilation errors first
- Ensure Java 17+ compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are available
